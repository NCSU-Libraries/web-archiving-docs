# Seed Metadata
Each seed in the collection should be assigned metadata as it is added to the collection. Metadata aids in the ongoing management and maintenance of the collection. Additionally, the metadata fields that you use are displayed under the collection and seed details that are found on [https://archive-it.org/home/ncsu-libraries](https://archive-it.org/home/ncsu-libraries). For tier 1 seeds (those found in the Daily, weekly or monthly crawl frequency) we use the following fields:

- Contributor - The college, office, department or individual responsible for the content of the page.
- Source - The legal entity (business, organization, university, individual) that the website belongs to.  
- Language - The primary language of the website.
- Creator - The creator of the website.
- Collector - 'NCSU Libraries'
- Title - The website title as it appears in the title meta tag in the website source.
- Publisher - The creator of the website.
- Earliest Capture - The year of the first capture date as it appears in the capture dates page for the seed (https://wayback.archive-it.org/COLLECTIONNUMBER/\*/FULLURL)
- Description - A full description of the website.
- Redirecting To - The URL that the seed is now redirecting to, if the redirection is permanent.
- Redirecting From - The URL that redirected to this seed, if the redirect is permanent.
- Format - 'Web'
- Subject - The primary subject of the website.


## Updating metadata
### Individual Seeds
For individual seed additions the metadata can be entered on the metadata tab of the seed details window. The seed must be added first, then you can end the seed details window and add metadata.

### Bulk Metadata Updates
Archive-It allows you to upload bulk metadata for all of your seeds. This is incredibly useful after adding a large number of new seeds. In order to update seed metadata in bulk you need to:

 1) Navigate to the collection overview page for the collection that you added the new seeds to.

 2) Click on the Metadata tab

 3) Click on the Bulk Seed Metadata tab

 4) Click Download Existing Seed Metadata, make a duplicate of this file and store it somewhere safe. The file has an .ods extension. It can be opened by Microsoft Excel in Windows. If you are using a Mac it must be opened using [OpenOffice Spreadsheets](http://www.openoffice.org/)

 5) Add metadata to the newly created seed URLs that should already appear in the Spreadsheets

 6) Return to the Bulk Seed Metadata tab in Archive-It

 7) Select 'Overwrite Existing Seed Metadata' and click upload

 8) Upload the .ods file that you modified
