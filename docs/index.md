# Web Archiving at NCSU Libraries
The [Special Collections Research Center](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc) (SCRC) at NCSU Libraries has established a Web Archive with the primary purpose of documenting for historic record the ever-changing web landscape of both official websites of NC State University as well as websites that complement the existing SCRC [collecting areas](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/collecting-areas) and collections. In order to facilitate our web archiving project we have partnered with the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org). The Internet Archive provides the tools and technology required to crawl, capture, store, and provide access to the websites in our collection. You can view all of our public collections by visiting [https://archive-it.org/home/ncsu-libraries](https://archive-it.org/home/ncsu-libraries)

## Description of Collections

#### [NC State University Web Sites](https://archive-it.org/collections/5838)
The NCSU Web Archive is partially dedicated to preserving the unique cultural heritage of our institution as it is represented on university websites.  We have identified most of the primary websites used by the university and are regularly capturing those sites for preservation and future access. These websites represent both large campus departments, individual colleges as well as departments and other organizations within those colleges.

#### [James B. Hunt Jr. Library Impact Collection](https://archive-it.org/collections/7087)
The James B. Hunt Jr. Library Impact collection is dedicated to documenting the impact that the [James B. Hunt library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/huntlibrary) has had on our students, our community and the greater library community as a whole. The web pages included in this collection are primarily articles that have been written about the library. As new articles are published they will be added to the collection.

#### [Landscape Architecture](https://archive-it.org/collections/7016)
The Landscape Architecture Web Archive is meant to complement the Special Collection Research Center's existing [Landscape Architecture collections](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/landscape-architecture). It contains websites of prominent landscape architects, landscape architecture firms as well as websites dedicated to large landscape architecture projects.


#### [Architecture and Design](https://archive-it.org/collections/6542)
The Architecture and Design Web Archive collection is meant to complement the Special Collection Research Center's [Architecture and Design collections](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/architecture-design). It features websites from top architectural and design firms in the region, as well as websites of award-winning architects.

## Web Archive Management
### Permissions Model
Many of the websites that we archive are official NC State University websites that are part of the official records of the university and are required to be included in our University Archives. For most non-NCSU websites that are related to our existing collections we contact the content owner to request permission to archive the site.

### Takedown Requests
NCSU Libraries has established a takedown request policy both for requests generated within the NCSU domain as well as for sites outside of the NCSU domain. Takedown requests from within the NCSU domain must come from the Office of the General Counsel. In the event that the owner of a website that is outside of the NCSU domain wishes for content to be removed they must notify the Libraries.
