# Collecting Guidelines
The primary goal of the NCSU Libraries web archiving initiative is to preserve the rich cultural heritage of the university as it appears on websites developed and maintained throughout the institution. This goal furthers the NC State Libraries’ mission to collect, preserve, and make accessible university records of historical and enduring importance. These records are maintained in the University Archives. In addition to collecting NC State websites, we may also collect websites that complement or are otherwise related to the Special Collections Research Center’s existing collecting strengths.

# Description of Collections
****
#### [**NC State University Web Sites**](https://archive-it.org/collections/5838)
The bulk of the NCSU Web Archive is dedicated to preserving the unique cultural heritage of our institution as it is represented on university websites. To meet these goals we have partnered with the Internet Archive. The Internet Archive provides us with the tools and technology required to crawl, capture, store, and provide access to the websites in our collection. We have identified many of the primary websites used by the university and are regularly capturing those sites for preservation.

#### [**James B. Hunt Jr. Library Impact Collections**](https://archive-it.org/collections/7087)
The James B. Hunt Jr. Library Impact collection is dedicated to documenting the impact that the James B. Hunt library has had on our students, our community and the greater library community as a whole. The web pages included in this collection are primarily articles that have been written about the library. As new articles are published they will be added to the collection.
